\section{Other Important Topics}
\subsection{Continuous Time vs Discrete Time}
When the controller is calculated by a computer, the system and feedback cannot be evaluated in continuous time. The system can be thought of as proceeding in time-steps.

\subsubsection{Z Transform}
The Z transform is the corollary to the Laplace Transform, only for discrete time where Laplace is for continuous.

\subsection{Optimization}
\subsubsection{Gradient Descent}

\subsection{Singular Value Decomposition}
