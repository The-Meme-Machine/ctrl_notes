\section{Nonlinear Methods}
A nonlinear plant is one that includes nonlinear functions in its dynamics (eg. powers, sine, cosine).
\subsection{Linearization}
The easiest way to control a nonlinear system is by making it linear. The Jacobian matrix (\underline{\ref{sec:jacobian}}) can be calculated about the point.
\begin{emphasis}
    Beware that the accuracy of the linearized model decreases the farther away (in terms of state) you are calculating. If compute power allows,
